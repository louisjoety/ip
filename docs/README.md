## Product intro:
This project is part of CS2113 iP component. The project
is about a chatbot called Echo. He is a Task management
chatbot that is able to keep track of different tasks,
mark them as done or undone and even delete the tasks.
When user enters and leaves the CLI, Echo will also load
and save the contents where appropriate.

## Adding deadlines

Allow users to key in task description along with the due date
(due date is accepted only in 3 formats: 
yyyy-MM-dd, d/M/yyyy, and MMM dd yyyy)

Example: `deadline return book /by 2/12/2019` or `deadline return book /by Dec 12 2019`
or `deadline return book /by 2019-12-02`

Example of expected output:
```
______________________________
deadline return book /by Dec 12 2019
______________________________
Got it. I've added this task:
[D] [ ] return book (by: Dec 12 2019)
Now you have 7 tasks in the list.
